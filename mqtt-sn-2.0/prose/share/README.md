# Shared Publications

This is a place to expose multiple formats of the MQTT-SN versin 2.0 to be spec like

- HTML
- Markdown+VisualHacksForGitHub
- PDF

The markdown source format prototype to be can generate with minimal tooling.
The basic idea is to keep verifiable component source files in the edit/src tree and build user facing tuned self-contained format outputs wirh the typical minimal open source tools that OASIS uses in the publication process anyway.
